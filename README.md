A NodeRed node implementation of the [netatmo api](http://dev.netatmo.com/) API.

This module is a complete rewrite of https://github.com/ssadams11/node-red-contrib-netatmo and is meant as a production ready version. As such, all parameters can be sent via message to the nodes including, but not limited, to authentication information.

Documentation is an ongoing process but help is available, in app, for every indidividual node.
